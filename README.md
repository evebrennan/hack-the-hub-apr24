# Chat with GPT

This project is a chatbot application built with Streamlit and integrated with the OpenAI GPT language model. It allows users to ask questions and receive responses generated by the GPT model.

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/gpt-chatbot.git
cd gpt-chatbot
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set up OpenAI API key

You need to obtain an API key from the OpenAI website. Once you have the API key, set it up as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

Replace `your_openai_api_key` with your actual OpenAI API key.

### 4. Run the application

Run the Streamlit application using the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start a local server, and you can access the chatbot application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with the chatbot by typing questions into the input box and pressing "Enter" or clicking the "Send" button. The chatbot will respond with generated text from the GPT model.
