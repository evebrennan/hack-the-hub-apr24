# Artificial Wisdom

This application is a chatbot designed to provide mental health support through various archetypes including "Medical Professional", "Spiritual Advisor", and "Old Age Wisdom". It utilizes Streamlit, a Python library for building web applications, and the OpenAI library with the gpt-4-0125-preview model. It allows users to ask questions and receive responses generated by the GPT model.

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/evebrennan/hack-the-hub-apr24.git
cd hack-the-hub-apr24
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set up OpenAI API key

You need to obtain an API key from the OpenAI website. Once you have the API key, set it up as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

Replace `your_openai_api_key` with your actual OpenAI API key.

### 4. Run the application

Run the Streamlit application using the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start a local server, and you can access the chatbot application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.
